## üéØ Windows 11 25H2 Specific Issues

### Privacy Settings SQLite Database

**Background**: Windows 11 24H2/25H2 changed privacy settings storage from registry to SQLite database.

**Camera & Microphone Master Toggles**
- **Issue**: Master toggles in Settings ‚Üí Privacy cannot be changed via script
- **Cause**: SQLite database-based storage (not registry)
- **Workaround**: 
  1. Script disables all default apps (no camera/mic access until user permits)
  2. User manually disables master toggles in Settings if desired
- **Impact**: Privacy by default is active - apps need user permission
- **Status**: Documented, workaround provided in script output

**App Permissions Master Toggles**
- **Issue**: Master toggles for Notifications, Contacts, Calendar, etc. cannot be changed via script
- **Cause**: SQLite database-based storage
- **Workaround**: Script disables default app permissions - user can manually disable master toggles
- **Impact**: Privacy by default is active
- **Status**: Documented, optional manual step

## üîê Security Features

### Enhanced Privilege Protection (UAC)

- **Issue**: Enhanced Privilege Protection Mode not yet active
- **Cause**: Feature announced in Baseline 25H2 but not yet released
- **Workaround**: Script sets registry keys for future-proofing
- **Impact**: Feature will activate in future Windows updates
- **Status**: Forward-compatible, settings prepared

### Windows LAPS

- **Issue**: Not available on Windows Home edition
- **Cause**: Enterprise/Pro feature
- **Workaround**: Script detects and skips gracefully
- **Impact**: Home users: use alternative password management
- **Status**: Expected, documented

---

## üåê Network & DNS

### DNS over HTTPS (DoH) Activation

- **Issue**: DoH may not activate immediately after configuration
- **Cause**: Windows caches DNS settings
- **Workaround**: Reboot or flush DNS cache (`ipconfig /flushdns`)
- **Impact**: DoH becomes active after reboot or DNS flush
- **Status**: Expected Windows behavior

### VPN Adapter DNS

- **Issue**: VPN adapters are intentionally skipped during DNS configuration
- **Cause**: By design - VPN DNS must remain unchanged
- **Impact**: VPN functionality preserved
- **Status**: Expected, correct behavior

### Firewall Strict Mode Compatibility

- **Issue**: Strict Inbound Firewall blocks ALL incoming connections
- **Cause**: Security-first design
- **Workaround**: Configure exceptions in Windows Firewall for needed services
- **Impact**: Maximum security, may break file sharing, remote desktop
- **Status**: By design - documented in script output

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Compatibility

### BitLocker Re-Encryption

- **Issue**: Upgrading from AES-128 to AES-256 requires full re-encryption
- **Cause**: Windows limitation - cannot convert in-place
- **Process**: Disable ‚Üí Wait for decryption ‚Üí Re-enable with AES-256
- **Duration**: 30-90 minutes depending on drive size
- **Impact**: Time-consuming but secure
- **Status**: Expected, documented in script output

### Service Disabling on Protected Systems

- **Issue**: Some services cannot be disabled (TrustedInstaller protected)
- **Cause**: Windows protects critical system services
- **Workaround**: Script attempts registry-based disable
- **Impact**: Some services may remain active
- **Status**: Expected, script handles gracefully

---

## üéÆ Compatibility Notes

### Xbox Services

- **Issue**: Xbox features (Game Bar, Game Mode, etc.) are disabled
- **Impact**: Xbox app, Game Pass, achievements may not work
- **Workaround**: Re-enable Xbox services manually if needed
- **Status**: By design - gaming features sacrificed for security

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Miracast / Wireless Display (Breaking Feature)

**ShellHost.exe Stack Buffer Overflow Warning**

**Symptom**:  
After running Wireless Display module, when user clicks "Cast" button (Windows + K or Quick Settings ‚Üí Cast/Wiedergeben), Windows displays error message:  
*"Das System hat in dieser Anwendung den √úberlauf eines stapelbasierten Puffers ermittelt. Dieser √úberlauf k√∂nnte einem b√∂sartigen Benutzer erm√∂glichen, die Steuerung der Anwendung zu √ºbernehmen."*  
(English: "The system detected a stack-based buffer overflow in this application. This overflow could allow a malicious user to gain control of the application.")

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Error ONLY appears when user actively attempts to cast (clicks Cast button), NOT automatically at system startup or during normal use

**What Happens:**
- User clicks "Cast" button in Quick Settings or presses Windows + K
- Windows Shell (ShellHost.exe) attempts to access disabled Miracast services
- System throws buffer overflow warning as safety mechanism
- **This is a COSMETIC error message, NOT an actual security vulnerability**
- The warning appears because Windows expects Miracast services to be available when Cast is invoked

**Functionality Permanently Lost:**
- Casting to Smart TV via Miracast
- Wireless Display projector connections
- DLNA/PlayTo Receiver
- Wi-Fi Direct screen mirroring
- "Cast" button in Quick Settings remains visible but non-functional

**How to AVOID This Issue:**

1. **In Interactive Mode:**
   - Select "Custom" mode
   - Deselect "Wireless Display / Miracast" module
   - Script will skip all Miracast hardening

2. **In Enforce/Audit Mode:**
   - Not currently configurable (all modules run)
   - Future versions may add module selection

**How to RESTORE Wireless Display:**

1. **Run Restore Script:**
   ```powershell
   .\Restore-SecurityBaseline.ps1
   ```
   
2. **What Gets Restored Automatically:**
   - ‚úÖ Services (ProjSvc, DevicePickerUserSvc, DevicesFlowUserSvc, DisplayEnhancementService)
   - ‚úÖ Registry keys (PlayToReceiver, AllowProjectionToPC, WirelessDisplay policies)
   - ‚úÖ Firewall rules (Wireless Display, Wi-Fi Direct rules re-enabled)

3. **What Requires Manual Reinstallation:**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Removed Apps: `Microsoft.Windows.SecondaryTileExperience`, `PPIProjection`, `Miracast` packages
   - These must be manually reinstalled from Microsoft Store
   - Search for "Wireless Display" or "Connect" app in Store

4. **Verification After Restore:**
   ```powershell
   # Check services
   Get-Service ProjSvc, DevicePickerUserSvc
   
   # Check registry
   Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PlayToReceiver" -Name Enabled
   
   # Test casting
   Windows + K (Open Cast menu)
   ```

**Why This Module Exists:**

Wireless Display protocols have known security vulnerabilities:
- Man-in-the-middle attack vectors
- Unencrypted screen mirroring
- Network discovery information leakage
- Potential for unauthorized screen capture

For maximum security (no casting needs), this module disables all wireless display functionality. For users who need casting, skip this module in Custom mode.

**Status:** By design - aggressive hardening with documented side effects

### Remote Access

- **Issue**: ALL remote access disabled (RDP, WinRM, Remote Assistance)
- **Impact**: Only physical access or Intune/SCCM management possible
- **Workaround**: Re-enable specific services if remote access needed
- **Status**: By design - maximum security

## üìù Script Behavior

### Non-Fatal Warnings

- **Issue**: Script shows ~200-300 non-fatal warnings
- **Examples**: Services not found, apps already removed, registry keys already exist
- **Cause**: Idempotent design - script is safe to re-run
- **Impact**: None - warnings are harmless and filtered in completion report
- **Status**: Expected, by design

### Restart Required

- **Issue**: Many features require restart to take effect
- **Affected**: VBS, Credential Guard, BitLocker, Firewall, Services
- **Workaround**: Reboot after script completion
- **Impact**: Features not active until reboot
- **Status**: Expected Windows behavior
