This document tracks known limitations and issues in **NoID Privacy - Windows 11 25H2 Security Baseline**.

---

## üîç Current Limitations

### Windows Defender Related

**ASR Rules Script Configuration**
- **Issue**: ASR rules cannot always be set via PowerShell script
- **Symptom**: `AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Ids` property not found
- **Cause**: Third-party antivirus active, or Defender service not fully available
- **Workaround**: Manually activate in Windows Security ‚Üí Virus & threat protection ‚Üí Manage settings ‚Üí Attack surface reduction rules
- **Impact**: Non-critical - script continues with other hardening
- **Status**: Expected behavior, documented in script output

**Defender Error 0x800106ba**
- **Issue**: Transient error when setting MpPreference
- **Symptom**: PUA configuration shows timing error
- **Cause**: Defender service initialization timing
- **Workaround**: Script falls back to registry-based PUA configuration
- **Impact**: Non-critical - PUA is still activated via registry
- **Status**: Handled automatically, cosmetic error only

**Controlled Folder Access Verification**
- **Issue**: Cannot verify Controlled Folder Access status programmatically
- **Cause**: Third-party AV or Defender not fully available
- **Workaround**: Manual verification in Windows Security
- **Impact**: Non-critical - feature may still be active
- **Status**: Expected when third-party AV is present

## üéØ Windows 11 25H2 Specific Issues

### Privacy Settings SQLite Database

**Background**: Windows 11 24H2/25H2 changed privacy settings storage from registry to SQLite database.

**Camera & Microphone Master Toggles**
- **Issue**: Master toggles in Settings ‚Üí Privacy cannot be changed via script
- **Cause**: SQLite database-based storage (not registry)
- **Workaround**: 
  1. Script disables all default apps (no camera/mic access until user permits)
  2. User manually disables master toggles in Settings if desired
- **Impact**: Privacy by default is active - apps need user permission
- **Status**: Documented, workaround provided in script output

**App Permissions Master Toggles**
- **Issue**: Master toggles for Notifications, Contacts, Calendar, etc. cannot be changed via script
- **Cause**: SQLite database-based storage
- **Workaround**: Script disables default app permissions - user can manually disable master toggles
- **Impact**: Privacy by default is active
- **Status**: Documented, optional manual step

## üîê Security Features

### Enhanced Privilege Protection (UAC)

- **Issue**: Enhanced Privilege Protection Mode not yet active
- **Cause**: Feature announced in Baseline 25H2 but not yet released
- **Workaround**: Script sets registry keys for future-proofing
- **Impact**: Feature will activate in future Windows updates
- **Status**: Forward-compatible, settings prepared

### Windows LAPS

- **Issue**: Not available on Windows Home edition
- **Cause**: Enterprise/Pro feature
- **Workaround**: Script detects and skips gracefully
- **Impact**: Home users: use alternative password management
- **Status**: Expected, documented

## üåê Network & DNS

### DNS over HTTPS (DoH) Activation

- **Issue**: DoH may not activate immediately after configuration
- **Cause**: Windows caches DNS settings
- **Workaround**: Reboot or flush DNS cache (`ipconfig /flushdns`)
- **Impact**: DoH becomes active after reboot or DNS flush
- **Status**: Expected Windows behavior

### VPN Adapter DNS

- **Issue**: VPN adapters are intentionally skipped during DNS configuration
- **Cause**: By design - VPN DNS must remain unchanged
- **Impact**: VPN functionality preserved
- **Status**: Expected, correct behavior

### Firewall Strict Mode Compatibility

- **Issue**: Strict Inbound Firewall blocks ALL incoming connections
- **Cause**: Security-first design
- **Workaround**: Configure exceptions in Windows Firewall for needed services
- **Impact**: Maximum security, may break file sharing, remote desktop
- **Status**: By design - documented in script output

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Compatibility

### BitLocker Re-Encryption

- **Issue**: Upgrading from AES-128 to AES-256 requires full re-encryption
- **Cause**: Windows limitation - cannot convert in-place
- **Process**: Disable ‚Üí Wait for decryption ‚Üí Re-enable with AES-256
- **Duration**: 30-90 minutes depending on drive size
- **Impact**: Time-consuming but secure
- **Status**: Expected, documented in script output

### Service Disabling on Protected Systems

- **Issue**: Some services cannot be disabled (TrustedInstaller protected)
- **Cause**: Windows protects critical system services
- **Workaround**: Script attempts registry-based disable
- **Impact**: Some services may remain active
- **Status**: Expected, script handles gracefully

## üéÆ Compatibility Notes

### Xbox Services

- **Issue**: Xbox features (Game Bar, Game Mode, etc.) are disabled
- **Impact**: Xbox app, Game Pass, achievements may not work
- **Workaround**: Re-enable Xbox services manually if needed
- **Status**: By design - gaming features sacrificed for security

### Miracast / Wireless Display

- **Issue**: Casting to Smart TV disabled
- **Impact**: "Cast" button in Quick Settings remains but doesn't work
- **Workaround**: Manually remove button (Windows + A ‚Üí Edit) or re-enable services
- **Status**: By design - wireless display is security risk

### Remote Access

- **Issue**: ALL remote access disabled (RDP, WinRM, Remote Assistance)
- **Impact**: Only physical access or Intune/SCCM management possible
- **Workaround**: Re-enable specific services if remote access needed
- **Status**: By design - maximum security

---

## üìù Script Behavior

### Non-Fatal Warnings

- **Issue**: Script shows ~200-300 non-fatal warnings
- **Examples**: Services not found, apps already removed, registry keys already exist
- **Cause**: Idempotent design - script is safe to re-run
- **Impact**: None - warnings are harmless and filtered in completion report
- **Status**: Expected, by design

### Restart Required

- **Issue**: Many features require restart to take effect
- **Affected**: VBS, Credential Guard, BitLocker, Firewall, Services
- **Workaround**: Reboot after script completion
