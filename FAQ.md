- Home power users who want enterprise-grade security
- Small business workstations
- IT professionals managing standalone systems
- Privacy-conscious users
- Security researchers

### Is this safe to use?

**Yes.** The script:
- ‚úÖ Follows Microsoft Security Baseline 25H2
- ‚úÖ Uses only official Windows commands
- ‚úÖ Includes backup & restore functionality
- ‚úÖ Has been tested on numerous systems
- ‚úÖ Is completely open-source (you can review the code)

### Can I undo changes?

**Absolutely!** Use the backup & restore functionality:
```powershell
.\Restore-SecurityBaseline.ps1
```

## üîß Installation & Usage

### Do I need to be an expert to use this?

**No.** The interactive mode guides you through:
1. Language selection
2. Mode selection (Audit/Enforce)
3. Automatic backup
4. Progress indicators
5. Clear status messages

### What's the difference between Audit and Enforce mode?

| Mode | What It Does | Safe? | Actual Changes? |
|------|--------------|-------|-----------------|
| **Audit** | Logs what would change | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| **Enforce** | Applies all changes | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |

**Recommendation**: Start with Audit mode to review changes.

### How long does it take?

- **Audit Mode**: ~5 minutes
- **Enforce Mode**: ~5-10 minutes
- **Reboot**: ~2 minutes (for VBS, Credential Guard, BitLocker)
- **Total**: 15-20 minutes including reboot

### Can I run it multiple times?

**Yes!** The script is idempotent - you can run it as many times as you want without issues.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Questions

### Does this replace antivirus software?

**No, it enhances Windows Defender.** The script:
- Configures Windows Defender to maximum protection
- Does **not** install third-party antivirus
- Works alongside most third-party AV (may show warnings)

If you have third-party AV, some Defender features (ASR, PUA) may be unavailable - this is normal and expected.

### What about ransomware protection?

**Multiple layers:**
- ‚úÖ Windows Defender with real-time protection
- ‚úÖ Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules (19 rules)
- ‚úÖ Controlled Folder Access (ransomware protection)
- ‚úÖ Exploit Protection (system-wide mitigations)
- ‚úÖ Smart App Control (reputation-based)

### Does this protect against all attacks?

**No solution is 100% secure.** This script provides:
- ‚úÖ Strong baseline security (Microsoft standards)
- ‚úÖ Defense-in-depth (multiple layers)
- ‚úÖ Privacy protection (telemetry disabled)
- ‚ùå Not a substitute for safe browsing habits
- ‚ùå Not a substitute for software updates
- ‚ùå Not a substitute for user awareness

### Will this stop zero-day attacks?

**It significantly reduces attack surface:**
- ‚úÖ ASR rules block many exploit techniques
- ‚úÖ Exploit protection mitigates zero-day exploitation
- ‚úÖ Credential Guard prevents credential theft
- ‚úÖ Smart App Control blocks unknown malware
- ‚ö†Ô∏è But zero-day attacks by definition exploit unknown vulnerabilities

## üíª Technical Questions

### What Windows version do I need?

**Windows 11 25H2** (Build 26100+)

Older versions may work but are not officially supported.

### Do I need TPM 2.0?

**Not required, but recommended.**

**Without TPM:**
- ‚úÖ Defender, Firewall, Privacy, DNS, etc. all work
- ‚ùå No BitLocker encryption
- ‚ùå No VBS (Virtualization Based Security)
- ‚ùå No Credential Guard

**With TPM 2.0:**
- ‚úÖ All features available
- ‚úÖ BitLocker with XTS-AES-256
- ‚úÖ VBS + HVCI
- ‚úÖ Credential Guard (LSA-PPL)

### What about domain-joined systems?

**This script is designed for standalone/workgroup systems.**

For domain environments:
- Use Group Policy instead
- Some settings (Password Policy, Account Lockout) require domain
- This script focuses on local machine hardening

### Does this work with third-party antivirus?

**Mostly yes, with caveats:**

‚úÖ **Works with:**
- Bitdefender
- Norton
- Kaspersky
- ESET
- McAfee
- Most others

‚ö†Ô∏è **May show warnings:**
- Some Windows Defender features unavailable (ASR, PUA)
- This is expected and harmless
- Core hardening still works

### Does this slow down my PC?

**Minimal performance impact:**
- VBS/Credential Guard: ~2-5% CPU overhead (modern CPUs)
- BitLocker: Negligible (hardware AES-NI acceleration)
- Telemetry disablement: Actually *improves* performance
- Bloatware removal: Improves startup time

**Real-world:** Most users notice no difference or slightly faster boot times.

## üîí Privacy Questions

### What telemetry is disabled?

**Comprehensive telemetry disablement:**
- ‚úÖ Diagnostic & usage data
- ‚úÖ Advertising ID
- ‚úÖ Activity history
- ‚úÖ App diagnostic info
- ‚úÖ Feedback requests
- ‚úÖ Handwriting & typing data
- ‚úÖ Location services
- ‚úÖ Windows Search web integration
- ‚úÖ Timeline sync
- ‚úÖ Xbox Game Bar telemetry

### Are Recall and Copilot removed?

**Yes, completely blocked (4 layers):**

1. **Services**: Disabled
2. **Registry**: Blocked
3. **Scheduled Tasks**: Disabled
4. **Group Policy**: Enforced

**Result:** Recall and Copilot are permanently disabled and cannot be re-enabled via Settings.

### What happens to my camera and microphone?

**Default-deny for apps:**
- ‚úÖ Apps have **no access** by default
- ‚úÖ You can enable per-app in Settings
- ‚úÖ System camera/mic still work (video calls, etc.)
- ‚úÖ User has full control

**Not blocked:** Windows Hello (facial recognition), if you use it.

### Can Microsoft still track me?

**Heavily reduced, but not 100%:**
- ‚úÖ ~95% of telemetry disabled
- ‚úÖ Advertising ID disabled
- ‚úÖ Activity history disabled
- ‚úÖ App diagnostics disabled
- ‚ùå Some core telemetry remains (e.g., Windows Update)
- ‚ùå Microsoft accounts still sync (if you use one)

**For 100% privacy:** Use local account instead of Microsoft account.

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "Script already running in another session"

**Cause:** Another instance is running or didn't exit cleanly.

**Solution:**
1. Wait for other instance to finish
2. Or reboot system
3. Or manually release mutex (advanced)

### "Access Denied" errors

**Cause:** Not running as Administrator.

**Solution:** Right-click PowerShell ‚Üí "Run as Administrator"

### VBS/Credential Guard not active after reboot

**Causes:**
1. No TPM 2.0
2. Virtualization disabled in BIOS
3. Hardware incompatibility

**Solution:**
1. Check TPM: `Get-Tpm`
2. Enable virtualization in BIOS/UEFI
3. Verify: `.\Verify-SecurityBaseline.ps1`

### BitLocker not activating

**Causes:**
1. No TPM 2.0
2. Insufficient disk space
3. Disk already encrypted by third-party tool

**Solution:**
1. Check TPM: `Get-Tpm`
2. Ensure 256 GB+ free space
3. Manual activation: Control Panel ‚Üí BitLocker

### Some settings not applied

**Check:**
1. Third-party AV may block some Defender features (expected)
2. Review transcript log: `C:\ProgramData\SecurityBaseline\Logs\`
3. Run `.\Verify-SecurityBaseline.ps1` to see what's active

### Script hangs or freezes

**Solution:**
1. Press `CTRL+C` to interrupt
2. Check transcript log for hanging operation
3. Report issue on GitHub with log attached

## üìä Compliance Questions

### Is this HIPAA/GDPR/SOC2 compliant?

**Partially.** This script provides:
- ‚úÖ Strong technical security controls
- ‚úÖ Privacy protection
- ‚úÖ Audit logging

**But compliance also requires:**
- ‚ùå Organizational policies
- ‚ùå Access controls
- ‚ùå Incident response procedures
- ‚ùå Regular audits
- ‚ùå Documentation

**Conclusion:** This script is a *component* of compliance, not complete compliance.

### Does this meet CIS Benchmark?

**CIS Level 1:** ~85% (standalone focus)  
**CIS Level 2:** ~90% (with privacy extensions)

**Missing:** Domain-specific settings (Password Policy, Account Lockout, etc.)

### What about DoD STIG?

**~75% coverage** (standalone environment)

**Missing:** Domain-specific requirements, physical security, FIPS 140-2 mode

## üîÑ Update & Maintenance

### How do I update to the latest version?

```powershell
cd C:\Tools\noid-privacy
git pull origin main
.\Apply-Win11-25H2-SecurityBaseline.ps1 -Mode Enforce
```

### Do I need to reapply after Windows Updates?

**Usually no.** Most settings persist through Windows Updates.

**Exception:** Major feature updates (e.g., 25H2 ‚Üí 26H2) may reset some settings. Re-run script after major updates.

### How often should I run this?

**Once is usually enough.**

**Re-run if:**
- After major Windows feature updates
- After hardware changes (new CPU, TPM)
- If you notice settings reverted
- When script updates with new features
